    <p>
        I am <strong>Dr. Sanket Mishra</strong>, an Assistant Professor at VIT-AP University and
        a dedicated researcher with expertise in machine learning applications for IoT.
        My academic journey includes a PhD in Engineering from BITS Pilani,
        focusing on statistical machine translation, reinforcement learning,
        and sequential anomaly detection for IoT data streams.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        In my role at VIT, I guide students in advanced topics like
        complex event processing and probabilistic modeling,
        and my current work explores how deep learning can optimize
        real-time IoT-based sensing solutions.
